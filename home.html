            <h3>Backstory:</h3>

            <p>Zed joined the Jedi as a toddler after his parents gave him over to Jedi Seekers that visited his homeworld of Malastare. He struggled with the training which created insecurities that would play into his temperment issues. Zed's master, a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cerean" target="_blank" id="cerean-link">Cerean</a> named Jin'Daar Puulkin, was taken by bounty hunters while they were on a mercy mission to Malastare. In a blinding hate-fuled rampage, Zed killed all of them except for their leader, who was able to make their escape with Jin'Daar in tow.</p>

            <p>Zed left the Jedi Order to search for his master after the Jedi Council forbade him from doing so. He spent the next year searching for leads on his masters whereabouts by mingling in the casinos in Coruscant's underbelly. In a stroke of luck one night, Zed encountered a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Trandoshan" target="_blank" id="trandoshan-link">Trandoshan</a> slaver named Aska Drenqisch and challenged her to a game of pazzak. As part of her wager, Aska revealed that she was the one who kidnapped Zed's master. Zed knew he would have to fight Aska and her crew to get to his master, but he couldn't do it alone.</p>

            <p>Knowing he was outmatched, Zed sought an alliance with discraced <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Karkarodon" target="_blank" id="karkarodon-link">Karkarodon</a> mob boss, Wilson Fishk. Zed offered his force powers and abilities in exchange for protection as part of his gang. The plan was simple, lead Wilson's party into conflict with Aska and take Jin'Daar in the shroud of chaos.</p>
